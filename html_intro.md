<a
  href="hhtps://www.google.com/"
  target="_blank - this will helps to open the tab in new page."
  title="here what you write it will be displayed here when you place the curser on the link"
></a>
```

- to add an image use the tag <img> tag

```html
<img src="dog.png" alt="This is a picture of the dog" height="200" width />
```

- we can make the images as the hyper links by placing the image tag in the anchor tag.
